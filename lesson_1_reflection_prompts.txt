How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The difference between two versions clearly show the changings that are made in the new file

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will me a lot in case if I need the version of code that I wrote previously, I can check that easily

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    In manually choosing a commit it will help us becase we save our code only when we want to save it and there is a commit message with each commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    git is a version controll system, it takes care of the different versions of the same code while google docs saves files and each files that is being saved is necessary. git allow saving multiple files in one commit because it track the code the different changes that occure in the code

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    we use git log to check the log history of the same file with commit message and a unique id , we use the git diff to compare the changings in two commits of the same file

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
	very confident
    

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    i'll try it for my code
